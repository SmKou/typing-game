# Specification: Typing Game

A typing game inspired by MondaySTG (Sisyphus Typing Game).

## Villainess
Zhonghua has just been hired as an architect to CorpStar, a full-service agency hired by businesses for rebranding, re-organization, and technical manufacturing. Externally, the agency seems competent, capable, and organized, but this terms out to be only its veneer. Internally, by moving fast and relying on workaholic high-achievers, the agency hides its chaos and consistent miscommunication between teams.

Keeping a low profile, Zhonghua acts as a designer and volunteers repeatedly to make runs between the teams of the agency. She meets Xiaocheng, the overworked receptionist-messenger of the executive office, as well as Xiaozong and Xiaohui, a cynical researcher and QA tester that have become frustrated with the agency's system and so, take joy in following along with the miscommunications and mishaps between teams. By chance, she crosses paths with Daquan, Dalan, and Dabai. Daquan and Dalan take an immediate liking to her, while Dabai dismisses her, though he dismisses everyone.

Taken unawares, Zhonghua is singled out by the director and trained to become another director like them. Encouraged by Xiaohei and Xiaohui to have fun, she takes to the training and excels, becoming the terror of the office. Unbeknownst to the director, Zhonghua leverages the help of her peers to change the agency's system, but cannot hide it for long and to her confusion, she discovers that the system was intentionally made to be the way it was.

Paralyzed by uncertainty, Zhonghua is surprised to be saved by Dabai of all people. Together, working at night to avoid detection and confrontation, they change the system, soon joined by their friends. As their colleagues learn of their efforts, one by one, whole teams start working at night to assist their efforts. When the director finds out, they threaten to fire Zhonghua and relocate Dabai, but faced with the protests of all the other workers, the director takes the matter to the executives.

The executives side with Zhonghua and Dabai.
